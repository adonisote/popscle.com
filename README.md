# Popscle
A Peer2Peer Learning Platform. Self-Directed-Learning comes with alot of challenges: deciding what to learn, picking a direction, lack of structure, keep the motivation up, finding updated resources, starting from zero, slow progress, non-visible progress, non-visible external recognition. We want to build Peer2Peer Learning communities, both public and private ones.

Popscle allows you to learn from people you look up to.
